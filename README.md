# Cryptocode
The cryptocode package provides a set of macros to ease the typesetting of pseudocode, algorithms and protocols. In addition it comes with a wide range of tools to typeset cryptographic papers. This includes simple predefined commands for concepts such as a security parameter or advantage terms but also flexible and powerful environments to layout game-based proofs or black-box reductions.

The cryptocode bundle is licensed under the LaTeX Project Public License
